1.2.3
Added logging of config locations to load_config for troubleshooting configs.

1.2.5
Fixed bug with files field type when no external files provided.

1.2.6
Fixed:
    Logic bug with blank field descriptors, tidied code flow
    Logic bug with invalid parent taxa in indexing 

1.2.7
* Restructured checking for singleton summary fields to give clearer sequence of error messages.
* Added system to allow users to forcibly ignore a GBIF match
* Moved to gitflow and Travis
* Now enforcing syntatically valid R names in field name

1.2.8
* Fixed bug in checking for spaces in external files
* Added option to ignore a specific GBIF id in taxon checking, allowing 
  users to refute GBIF taxonomy.

2.0.0
* Shifting to a pure Python 3 implementation. This is a hard shift from 2
  to 3: there will be no support for 2/3 in parallel.

3.0.0
* Major refactor to split one giant nested class in a single file implementation
  into a set of modules dealing with different parts of the structure. This
  separation makes it easier to create unit testing of inputs and also facilitates 
  code reuse for different file formats and functions.
* Unit testing for modules.
* Addition of Zenodo upload and publication tools.

Roadmap:

* Addition of genbank to gbif taxon matching and representation.
* Validation of zipfiles of CSV files.
