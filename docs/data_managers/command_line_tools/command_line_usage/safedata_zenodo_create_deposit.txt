cl_prompt $ safedata_zenodo create_deposit -h
usage: safedata_zenodo create_deposit [-h] [-c CONCEPT_ID] [-i]

Create a new deposit draft. The concept_id option uses a provided Zenodo
concept ID to creates a draft as a new version of an existing data set.

subcommands that work with an existing deposit.

The --id-to-stdout option can be provided to explicitly return the new
deposit ID to stdout, where it can be captured for use in shell scripts.
All other logging is written to stderr.

                A Zenodo concept ID
  -i, --id-to-stdout
