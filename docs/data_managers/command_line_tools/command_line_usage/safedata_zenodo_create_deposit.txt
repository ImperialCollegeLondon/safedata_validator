cl_prompt $ safedata_zenodo create_deposit -h
usage: safedata_zenodo create_deposit [-h] [-n NEW_VERSION] [-i]

Create a new deposit draft. 

The new version option takes the record ID of the most recent version of an existing
dataset and creates a new deposit as a new version of that dataset. Versions of
datasets are grouped under a single concept ID, which always redirects to the most
recent version. Use the most recent version ID and _not_ the concept ID here.

When successful, the function downloads and saves a JSON file containing the
resulting Zenodo deposit metadata. This file is used as an input to other
subcommands that work with an existing deposit.

The --id-to-stdout option can be provided to explicitly return the new
deposit ID to stdout, where it can be captured for use in shell scripts.
All other logging is written to stderr.

                ID.
  -i, --id-to-stdout
