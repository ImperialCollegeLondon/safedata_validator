cl_prompt $ safedata_zenodo -h
usage: safedata_zenodo [-h] [-r RESOURCES] [-q] SUBCOMMAND ...

Publish validated datasets to Zenodo using a command line interface.

    This is a the command line interface for publishing safedata validated
    datasets to Zenodo, downloading information and maintaining a local
    copy of the datasets in the file structure required by the R safedata
    package.

    The safedata_zenodo command is used by providing subcommands for the
    different actions required to publish a validated dataset. The list of
    subcommands (with aliases) is shown below and individual help is
    available for each of the subcommands:

        safedata_zenodo subcommand -h

    The subcommands for this tool use two different JSON format metadata
    files:

    * A dataset metadata file (`dataset_json`). This is the output from
        using the `safedata_validate` tool. Some of the information in this
        file is used to create the Zenodo dataset description, and all of
        the data is used to describe a dataset on the separate metadata
        server.

    * A Zenodo metadata file (`zenodo_json`), that describes the metadata
        associated with a Zenodo deposit or published record.

    Note that most of these actions are also available via the Zenodo website.
