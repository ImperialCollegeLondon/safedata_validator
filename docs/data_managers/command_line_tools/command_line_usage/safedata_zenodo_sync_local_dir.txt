usage: safedata_zenodo sync_local_dir [-h] [--not-just-xlsx]

Synchronize a local data directory

This subcommand allows a safedata developer or community maintainer to
create or update such a directory with _all_ of the resources in the Zenodo
community, regardless of their public access status. This forms a backup
(although Zenodo is heavily backed up) but also provides local copies of the
files for testing and development of the code packages.

The file structure of the directory follows that used by the safedata R
package, used to store metadata and files downloaded from a safedata
community on Zenodo and from a safedata metadata server. The
`safedata_validator` configuration file will need to include the metadata
API.

By default, only the XLSX files containing metadata and data tables are
downloaded, ignoring any additional files, which are often large.

positional arguments:
  datadir       The path to a local directory containing an existing safedata
                directory or an empty folder in which to create one

options:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  --not-just-xlsx
                Should large non-xlsx files also be downloaded.
  --replace-modified
                Should locally modified files be overwritten with the archive
                version
