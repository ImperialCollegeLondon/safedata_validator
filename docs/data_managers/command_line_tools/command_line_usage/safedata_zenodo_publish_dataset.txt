This subcommand runs through the complete publication process for a validated
dataset and any external files. It does not provide all of the options of the
subcommands for individual steps but covers the main common usage of the
safedata_zenodo command. If the publication process fails, the resulting partial
deposit is discarded. All of the files in the deposit must be replaced.
