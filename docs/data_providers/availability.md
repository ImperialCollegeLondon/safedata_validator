# Data availability

When your dataset is published, the **metadata** will be always immediately publicly
visible on Zenodo. This includes details of the data fields, the spatial scope, the date
range and the like.

You will also need to set the dataset access rights (see
[here](data_format/summary.md#access-status)). We prefer that as much data as possible
is submitted as **Open access** but support two alternative access models:

## Embargoed data

If you want to restrict access to the data while you work on papers, then you can
specify an **Embargo period**. The organisation you submit to will likely set a maximum
embargo period, which they should communicate to you. The metadata for embargoed
datasets will still be visible, so that researchers can see that the data exists but any
data files will only become available once the embargo date has passed.

Obviously, you can choose to provide embargoed data to other researchers within the
embargo period. If researchers contact the organisation you submit your data to for
access to data during the embargo period, they should **always** pass the request on
to you.

## Restricted data

There are possible rare cases where a dataset may be published as a Restricted dataset.
You must contact your organisation's data manager in advance to explain why you think
restriction is appropriate: they should **never** publish a restricted dataset without
discussion.

Restricted datasets must provide a set of access conditions, which will be visible on
Zenodo along with the dataset metadata. Zenodo provides a link to request access to
restricted datasets: these will come first to your organisations data manager but they
will then **always** contact the original data owners before permitting access.

## Altering the access rights

It is possible to alter the access rights of a published dataset, so if you want to
alter the access rights of a dataset, for example to release an embargo or to remove
restrictions, then contact the data manager of the organisation you submitted the
dataset to.

## Data curation

All of the data submitted to a particular organisation is published through a single
Zenodo account owned by the organisation. This central account is purely used for data
curation so that datafiles can always be accessed, records can always be updated and so
that there is a final point of contact for data. This helps to ensure the long-term
availability and maintenance of the organisation's data repository.

This is entirely separate from the authorship and ownership of the data: the citation
for the data will always be to the original set of authors provided in the metadata.
Embargoed or restricted data will never be made available within the embargo period or
without discussion with data authors. Data authors will always be consulted about issues
arising with their datasets.
