# Data availability

When your dataset is published, the **metadata** will be always immediately publicly visible on Zenodo. 
This includes details of the data fields, the spatial scope, the date range and the like. 

You will also need to set the dataset access rights (see [here](data_format/summary.md#access-status)). 
We prefer that as much data as possible is submitted as **Open access** but support two alternative 
access models:

## Embargoed data

If you want to restrict access to the data while you work on papers, then you can specify an
**Embargo period** of up to two years. The metadata will still be visible, so that
researchers can see that the data exists but any data files will only become available once
the embargo date has passed.

Obviously, you can choose to provide embargoed data to other researchers within the embargo
period. If researchers contact the SAFE Project for access to data during the embargo period,
we will **always** pass the request on to you.

## Restricted data

There are possible rare cases where a dataset may be published as a Restricted dataset. You 
must [contact us](mailto:data@safeproject.net) in advance to explain why you think restriction 
is appropriate: we will **never** publish a restricted dataset without discussion.  

Restricted datasets must provide a set of access conditions, which will be visible on Zenodo
along with the dataset metadata. Zenodo provides a link to request access to restricted datasets:
these will come first to our data curation account but we will then __always__ contact the original 
data owners before permitting access.

# Altering the access rights

We are able to alter the access rights of a published dataset, so if you want to alter the access 
rights of a dataset, for example to release an embargo or to remove restrictions, then 
[email us](mailto:data@safeproject.net).


# Data curation

All of the data submitted through SAFE is published through a single  Zenodo account (`the_safe_project`). 
This central account is purely used for data curation so that we can always access datafiles, update records 
and act as a final point of contact for data. This helps us ensure the long-term availability and maintenance
 of the SAFE data repository.

This is entirely separate from the authorship and ownership of the data: the citation for the data will always 
be to the original set of authors provided in the metadata. We will never make embargoed or restricted data 
available within the embargo period or without discussion with data authors. We will always consult data 
authors about issues arising with their datasets.
