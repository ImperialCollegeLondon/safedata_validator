# Build notes 

TODO Incomplete

### Configure `git`

It is easier if `git` is configured to push new tags along with commits. This essentially just means that new releases can be sent with a single commit, which is simpler and saves Travis from building both the the code commit and then the tagged version. This only needs to be set once.

```sh
set git config --global push.followTags true
```


Using git-flow and travis (although no tests at present so travis does very little except for testing the thing builds)

Use git flow to create a release and then bump the version number in `version.py`.

Check the package builds and installs locally:

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

Once all seems well,  finish the release, go to the master branch and push it to create the tagged version on github.

Once that is done, switch back to `develop` and bump the version number to add `.post9000` to show the code is in development again.

## PyPi

To upload the new version to testpypi, checkout master and run

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

Remembering to change the version number, you can then create an account at pypi and testpypi and use `twine` to test:

```
twine upload -r testpypi dist/*1.2.8*
```

and then - once that seems to have gone ok - release the distribution for use via `pip`

```
twine upload dist/*1.2.7*
```


## Documentation

The package documentation is maintained using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and deployed to [https://safedata-validator.readthedocs.io/](https://safedata-validator.readthedocs.io/). MkDocs can be installed using:

```
pip install mkdocs
```


In order to build and deploy the documentation.

* Edit the source files in the `docs` folder.
* From the package root, run `mkdocs build`. This will create the docs site in the `site` folder - note that this folder is not included in the git repo.
* Once you have checked the local copy of the documentation, then commiting the changes to the repository will automatically trigger a rebuild of the package documentation.
