# Frequently asked questions

The error messages from the data formatting checker can be a bit terse, so here are some common questions.

# Taxa worksheet 

**XXX found in GBIF backbone, but additional parent information is incompatible**

You only have to provide parent information when GBIF can't find the taxon itself. If you do provide parent information for a taxon that is in GBIF, then we check the two are compatible. This isn't usually a problem but it can go wrong if the taxon is considered a synonym.

For example, the fish species _Barbodes sealei_ is considered by GBIF to be a synonym  for _Puntius sealei_, and the taxonomic hierarchy we get from GBIF is that the species is in the genus _Puntius_. So, if you put _Barbodes_ as the parent genus, you will get an error because _Barbodes_ is not in that taxonomic hierarchy. We do not take a view on whether GBIF is correct - we record both synonyms and canon names in the taxon index for the dataset. 

The solution is to remove the Parent information - you would then get a warning about the synonymy but no error.

# Data worksheets

** Cannot parse data: field_name row not found **

Did you include the Locations and Taxa worksheets in your data worksheets list? Don't - we automatically check for these two sheets and they have a different format to data worksheets, so you will get this error when the checker code tries to read field descriptions and fails.
