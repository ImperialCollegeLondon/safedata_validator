# Introduction

The agreement for research projects working at the SAFE Project states that all
project data are submitted to the SAFE Project data repository, so that it is
available to future researchers. In order to make it easy for data to be found
and used in the future, we need researchers to provide some (relatively!) simple
metadata information in their datafiles.

This documentation describes:

1. the data formatting required to submit data to SAFE, and
2. the software used (the python module `safedata_validator` to validate
   formatted data.

If you are planning to submit data, the  process in overview is:

* Prepare your data following the formatting information on this site.
* Go to the SAFE Project website and [Submit your
  dataset](https://www.safeproject.net/datasets/submit_dataset).
* We will automatically validate the data formatting.
* If the validation succeeds then we will publish it on Zenodo.
* If the validation fails then you will get an error report so you can fix the
  problems and resubmit.

You can see published datasets at the [SAFE Project Zenodo
community](https://zenodo.org/communities/safe/).

!!! Warning

    You **must not** publish your dataset directly to Zenodo. This skips the validation
    step and means that the datasets are not linked together under our
    [curation account](availability.md#data-curation).

There is a separate document containing [build notes](build_notes.md) on the
package design and build process.
