# `safedata` at the SAFE project

TODO - Make this into a narrative rather than a bullet point list

- For SAFE project data access queries [contact us here](mailto:data@safeproject.net)
- Embargo period max of 2 years
- TODO - track down Metadata sever info
- Zenodo account (`the_safe_project`)
- This is particularly important for RCUK funded research, who have agreed to let us
    host all of the SAFE data under a common portal on the condition that Research
    Council funding is clearly acknowledged.
