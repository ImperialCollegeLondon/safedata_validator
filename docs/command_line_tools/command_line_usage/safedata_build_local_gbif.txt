usage: safedata_build_local_gbif [-h] [-t TIMESTAMP] outdir

Build a local GBIF database.

    This tool builds an SQLite database of the GBIF backbone taxonomy to use in
    validation by safedata_validate. There are multiple versions of the dataset, and the
    available versions can be seen here:

        https://hosted-datasets.gbif.org/datasets/backbone/

    The tool will optionally take a timestamp - using the format '2021-11-26' -  to
    build a particular version, but defaults to the most recent version.

positional arguments:
  outdir                Location to create database file.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TIMESTAMP, --timestamp TIMESTAMP
                        The time stamp of a database archive version to use.
