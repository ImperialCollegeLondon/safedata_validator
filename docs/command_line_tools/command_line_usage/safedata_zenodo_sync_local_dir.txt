cl_prompt $ safedata_zenodo sync_local_dir -h
usage: safedata_zenodo sync_local_dir [-h] [--xlsx_only XLSX_ONLY] datadir

Synchronize a local data directory

This subcommand allows a safedata developer or community maintainer to create or
update such a directory with _all_ of the resources in the Zenodo community,
regardless of their public access status. This forms a backup (although Zenodo is
heavily backed up) but also provides local copies of the files for testing and
development of the code packages.

The file structure of the directory follows that used by the safedata R package,
used to store metadata and files downloaded from a safedata community on Zenodo and
from a safedata metadata server. The `safedata_validator` configuration file will
need to include the metadata API.

positional arguments:
  datadir               The path to a local directory containing an existing
                        safedata directory or an empty folder in which to
                        create one

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --xlsx_only XLSX_ONLY
                        Should the download ignore large non-xlsx files,
                        defaulting to True.
