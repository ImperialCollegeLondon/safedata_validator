cl_prompt $ safedata_zenodo sync_local_dir -h
usage: safedata_zenodo sync_local_dir [-h] [-a API] [--xlsx_only XLSX_ONLY]
                                      datadir

The safedata R package defines a directory structure used to store metadata
and files downloaded from a safedata community on Zenodo and from a safedata
metadata server. This tool allows a safedata developer or community
maintainer to create or update such a directory with _all_ of the resources
in the Zenodo community, regardless of their public access status. This
forms a backup (although Zenodo is heavily backed up) but also provides
local copies of the files for testing and development of the code packages.

If this is a new data directory, you also need to provide the API url for
the a server providing safedata metadata.

positional arguments:
  datadir               The path to a local directory containing an existing
                        safedata directory or an empty folder in which to
                        create one

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a API, --api API     An API from which JSON dataset metadata can be
                        downloaded. If datadir is an existing safedata
                        directory, then the API will be read from `url.json`.
  --xlsx_only XLSX_ONLY
                        Should the download ignore large non-xlsx files,
                        defaulting to True.
