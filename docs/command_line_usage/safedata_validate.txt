This program validates an Excel file formatted as a SAFE dataset. As it
runs, it outputs a report that highlights any problems with the formatting.
Much of the validation is to check that the data meets our metadata
standards and is internally consistent. 

However, the package uses external resources to perform validation of taxa
and sampling locations and to provide other information. For this reason,
using this program requires you to provide a configuration file for these
resources or to have installed a configuration file in a standard location
(see the package website API for details.)

If validation is successful, then a JSON format file containing key metadata
will be saved to the same location as the valdiated file. The JSON metadata
is used in the dataset publication process.

positional arguments:
  filename              Path to the Excel file to be validated.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p VALID_PID, --project_id VALID_PID
                        If provided, check that the project ID within the file
                        matches this integer. Multiple values can be provided
                        to generate a set of valid IDs.
  --validate_doi        Check the validity of any publication DOIs, provided
                        by the user. Requires a web connection.
  --chunk_size CHUNK_SIZE
                        Data are loaded from worksheets in chunks: the number
                        of rows in a chunk is set by this argument
  --version             show program's version number and exit
