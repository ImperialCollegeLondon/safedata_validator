This module describes classes and methods used to both assess the validity of
GenBank taxonic data, and to check that the taxonomic data is consistent with
that stored in GBIF. When a conflict arises the user will be informed and asked
to reduce the level of taxonomic detail they provide to the point where GenBank
and GBIF are in agreement.

FURTHER DETAILS OF STUFF DEFINED.
